/**
 * The simulation bucket's own update loop on the frame workers ({@code entityUpdateParallel}).
 *
 * <p>Stock {@code MovingObjectUpdateSchedulerUpdateBucket.update(int)} walks one of the bucket's sub-lists and, per
 * entity, calls {@code setCurrentSimulationLevel(level)}, {@code preupdate()}, {@code frameStep()} and
 * {@code update()} — in that order, four calls, nothing else. This batch runs that same sequence per entity on the
 * {@link FrameBatch} workers instead of one entity after another on the game thread. The scheduler's other batches
 * ({@link AnimBatch}, {@link ActionEval}, {@link SeparateBatch}) all sit around the simulation; this one is the
 * simulation, which is why it ships off.
 *
 * <p><b>One bucket at a time, never across two.</b> The bucket sets {@code GameTime.perObjectMultiplier} to its own
 * frame mod for the whole of its loop and back to 1 afterwards. That field is a single value on the {@code GameTime}
 * singleton, so it is only constant — and therefore only correct — while one bucket's entities are in flight. Two
 * buckets batched at once would each publish their own multiplier and every entity would read whichever landed last.
 *
 * <p>What stays on the game thread, in the bucket before the batch is filled: the {@code IsoDeadBody} entries (they
 * go to the cell's remove set, shared and order-dependent) and the reused-zombie debug branch. Everything the batch
 * did not take runs inline exactly as before, and an entity that throws on a worker is reported once and turns the
 * batching off for the rest of the session — the bucket then walks stock's loop from the next frame on.
