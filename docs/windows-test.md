# Testing the overrides on Windows

First Windows test of the class overrides. Nothing has to be compiled on Windows:
the zip built on Linux carries the finished class files, and the runtime guard
(`pzopt.Overrides`) checks both the game revision and the sha256 of every stock
class it shadows against the Windows jar. If anything differs it logs one line and
the game runs as stock, so the worst case of a mismatch is "no effect".

## Before rebooting (on Linux)

Get the zip somewhere Windows can read. The Linux side is ZFS and XFS, which
Windows cannot mount, so use one of:

```sh
# a) the NTFS partition (sda2, 480 GB, unmounted right now)
sudo mount -t ntfs3 /dev/sda2 /mnt && cp build/pzopt-b0bbce05d5-classes.zip /mnt/ && sudo umount /mnt

# b) a GitHub release asset (download from a browser on Windows)
gh release create win-test-b0bbce05d5 build/pzopt-b0bbce05d5-classes.zip \
  --title "Windows test build (42.20.4 / b0bbce05d5)" --notes "class overrides for the Windows test, see docs/windows-test.md"
```

Also bring this file (or open it on GitHub).

## On Windows

All commands are PowerShell. `$PZ` is the game folder; adjust it if Steam is not
in the default place (Steam, right-click the game, Manage, Browse local files).

### 1. Check the game

- Steam, Properties, Betas: the game must be on **Build 42.20.4**. Any other
  version makes the guard disable the overrides.
- Close the game.

```powershell
$PZ = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ProjectZomboid"
Get-Content "$PZ\ProjectZomboid64.json" | Select-String -Context 0,3 classpath
```

The classpath block must list `"."` **before** `"projectzomboid.jar"`. If it does
not, stop: loose class files would never load on this depot.

Confirm the folders the zip will create do not already exist (they should not on
a stock install; `media` exists and only gets one Lua file added under
`media\lua\client\pzopt`):

```powershell
Test-Path "$PZ\pzopt"; Test-Path "$PZ\zombie"; Test-Path "$PZ\org"; Test-Path "$PZ\se"
```

All four should print `False`.

### 2. Install

Unpack the zip straight into the game folder. It only adds files; it never
touches `projectzomboid.jar`.

```powershell
Expand-Archive -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\pzopt-b0bbce05d5-classes.zip" -DestinationPath $PZ
Get-Content "$PZ\pzopt-files.txt" | Measure-Object -Line     # 707 on the 153e43e, 683e1be and 3f8f7dc releases, 695 on the 56b92b9 release, 693 on the f43331b, b929049 and e12eb89 releases, 687 on the 84def73 release, 677 on the e8cf412 and c7145ad releases, 676 on the ccc02be release, 675 on the 604498a and ea05422 releases, 658 on the 3dd6fba, ad13b6d and c17a039 releases, 648 on the 6207264 release, 644 on the 9bd1b73 release, 638 on the e924835 release, 637 on the 1e023a1 and 10bbe1a releases, 627 on the 5e6645c release, 613 on the ab4b22b, b70f234, e3a5fdc, a41fd53, 778d733 and 8255778 releases, 609 on the 2d48ba9 and dc24455 releases, 603 on the e1b28ab release, 533 on the 25052d9 release, 532 on the ba77a60 release, 524 on the b3904da release, 498 on the edb8077 release, 495 on the b973be9 and 1d9fe0e releases, 487 on the 50b2d94 release, 485 on the ecc868d release, 470 on the d01292e release, 469 on the eb305b6 release, 464 on the b18d84f and 4ecf3f3 releases, 421 on the 8cb8ccf, 8497d41, be1f28a and a4ed6f9 releases, 411 on the a9a1558 release, 393 on the 4ab3fe8 release, 392 on the 2c0ca9d release, 390 on the 53fe0e8 and 4826971 releases, 389 on the 76755df release, 386 on the 102ccf9 release, 385 on the e5d025a release, 384 on the d36540a release, 381 on the da3cdea release, 345 on the 1555855 release, 244 on the 2980cf3 and 3441a1c releases, 224 on the db825a0 release, 220 on the cd1a8de and cb48693 releases, 189 on the 0029f16 and 8bbc11a releases, 184 on the 51a6f78 release, 178 on the d434cde release, 177 on the 31f27f4 and c69c085 releases, 162 on the dcc0ce9 release, 161 on the 8889f72 release, 152 on the 1cf5080 and 667b210 releases, 146 on the 75f9365, f93158f, 4dbe655 and cc99c05 releases (131 on b0d4fe6, 115 on e398ce5, 105 on the 2d34aa9 release, 97 on the 2026-09-19 test build)
Get-Content "$PZ\pzopt\build-info.properties" | Select-String "^revision"
```

`Expand-Archive` refuses to overwrite existing files unless `-Force` is given.
Do not give it.

### 3. First launch

Launch from Steam normally. On the first boot the caches under
`%USERPROFILE%\Zomboid\pzopt\` (animation clips, texture-pack index, Lua
prototypes) are written, so it is a slower boot than the ones after it.

Then read the log:

```powershell
Select-String -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\Zomboid\console.txt" -Pattern "\[pzopt\]" | Select-Object -First 40
```

What to look for:

| Line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[pzopt] loaded override zombie.iso.IsoChunk (target revision b0bbce05d5, active)` | the guard passed; one such line per class |
| `game revision is X but overrides were built for b0bbce05d5; overrides disabled` | Windows depot is a different revision. Note X and stop; the test is over |
| `jar copy of ... differs from the one the overrides were built against` | same revision, different class bytes on the Windows jar. Note which class; the overrides are off |
| no `[pzopt]` line at all | the classes did not load. Re-check the classpath in step 1 and that `$PZ\pzopt\Overrides.class` exists |

If the guard disabled the overrides, everything below is moot but the game
should still run normally. That result is itself worth bringing back.

### 4. What to test

Do these in order and write down what happens at each step.

1. **Main menu.** Time from double-click to the menu, roughly. The TIS logo
   screens are skipped; the menu should appear directly.
2. **Options, Display.** The framerate combo has an **Uncapped** entry and
   300/330/400/430/500 fps entries, and a separate **Menu framerate** combo
   sits below it. Pick a value, apply, quit to desktop, relaunch: the value
   must survive. The setting lives in `%USERPROFILE%\Zomboid\pzopt\framecap.ini`.
3. **Continue a save.** Use a copy of a save, not the real one, if the save
   matters. Note the Continue-to-world time.
4. **Drive at max zoom** for a couple of minutes on a road with trees and
   buildings. Watch for:
   - black one-tile rectangles beside walls or black floor rectangles
   - trees that are missing, or that pop in late next to buildings
   - windows or glass doors that do not draw, or draw when they should be cut away
   - chunk edges that arrive noticeably late at speed
   - stutter on the 2 s beat (that would be a mod, PZDashboard, not this)
5. **Walk through buildings.** Cutaway walls around the player, doors and
   curtains opening and closing, windows breaking: the baked chunk textures must
   refresh when the state changes.
6. **Quit to menu and Continue again** without closing the game.
7. **Frame rate.** With the in-game limiter at Uncapped and vsync off, note the
   fps the game shows (or use the Steam overlay's fps counter). No MangoHud on
   Windows; a rough number is enough.

For a stock comparison on the same machine, press **Disable all (stock game)** in
Options > Optimizations and relaunch (**Enable all** brings the defaults back), or
create `$PZ\pzopt.properties` with the master switch off and relaunch; delete the
file to return to the defaults:

```properties
enabled=false
```

Every override then takes its stock path, the same fallback a build mismatch uses;
the per-key switches are ignored while it is off.

For per-frame numbers add `instrument=true` to that file (or to an otherwise
empty one): the game then writes `pzopt-frames.out` and `pzopt-chunks.out` in
`%USERPROFILE%\Zomboid`, which `harness/analyze.py` can read back on Linux.

### 5. If the game crashes

Bring back `%USERPROFILE%\Zomboid\console.txt` and any `hs_err_pid*.log` from
`$PZ`. The line right before the crash in console.txt is usually the answer.

### 6. Uninstall

Removes exactly the files the zip added, then the empty folders. The jar was
never modified, so no Steam file verification is needed.

```powershell
$PZ = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ProjectZomboid"
Get-Content "$PZ\pzopt-files.txt" | ForEach-Object { Remove-Item -LiteralPath (Join-Path $PZ $_) -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue }
Remove-Item "$PZ\pzopt-files.txt", "$PZ\pzopt.properties" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
foreach ($d in "pzopt","zombie","org","se","media\lua\client\pzopt") {
  Get-ChildItem "$PZ\$d" -Recurse -Directory -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Sort-Object FullName -Descending |
    Where-Object { -not (Get-ChildItem $_.FullName -Force) } | Remove-Item
  if ((Test-Path "$PZ\$d") -and -not (Get-ChildItem "$PZ\$d" -Force)) { Remove-Item "$PZ\$d" }
}
Test-Path "$PZ\pzopt"   # False
```

The caches in `%USERPROFILE%\Zomboid\pzopt\` can be deleted by hand; the game
never reads them without the overrides installed.

## Results 2026-09-19 (first Windows test)

Machine: the same box booted into Windows 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2024 (Ryzen 7 9800X3D, RTX 4090,
NVIDIA driver 616.92 / 32.0.16.1692, Azul Zulu 25 bundled JRE, ZGC). Game at
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ProjectZomboid`, Build 42.20.4, jar sha256 and
size identical to the Linux depot's, classpath `"."` before the jar. Desktop 5120x2160, game
fullscreen at desktop resolution, vsync off, in-game cap 500 fps (`framecap.ini gameFps=500`),
launched through Steam. No MangoHud; utilization from `Get-Counter` + `nvidia-smi`.

Install: `Expand-Archive` of the zip, 97 manifest files, no pre-existing folders. Guard: every
override logged `active`, no revision or class-hash mismatch. Nothing had to be compiled.

### Boot

| Boot | Menu after process start | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (cold caches) | ~40 s | 1522 anim clips written, FMOD "Error initializing output device" (no audio device set up on this Windows install, not ours) |
| 2 (warm) | 21 s | anim clip cache 2161 hits / 0 misses |
| 3+ (warm, bench runs) | ~15 s | boot pump 5.9 s, anim sets preloaded 1.0–1.2 s |

Quitting from the main menu of boot 1 crashed on exit: `EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION` in
`ZNetJNI64.dll` under `SteamWorkshop.n_GetInstalledItemFolders`, reached from
`RenderThread.shutdown → IsoPuddles.getInstance → Texture.getSharedTexture → ZomboidFileSystem.validatePrefix`
(the puddle renderer is constructed for the first time during shutdown and asks Steam for mod
folders after the Steam API is gone). Stock code path; a menu quit of a later boot did not
reproduce it. Dump kept as `harness/runs/win-boot-20260919/hs_err_pid3536-boot1-quit.log`.

Frame-cap combos: the maintainer confirmed Uncapped, 300–500 and the separate Menu framerate combo; a
500 fps choice survived a relaunch (`framecap.ini`, `[pzopt] frame cap: game 500 fps`).

### Bench route, optimized vs stock switches

`harness/run-win.ps1` (a PowerShell port of the run.sh steps a bench needs) on the committed
bench save, `--flag zoom=max` (max zoom on this install is **2.0**, not the 2.5 of the Linux
runs: options.ini `zoomLevels2x` tops out at 200), dashboard off, `instrument=true`. Stock =
every switch in the list above off. Analysis with `harness/analyze.py` (embeddable Python 3.12
under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python312-embed`).

| Run | fps mean | frame mean | p50 | p90 | p99 | p99.9 | max | >33 ms |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `win-bench-stock-20260919-222950` | 172.5 | 5.8 ms | 4.8 | 10.1 | 19.1 | 28.4 | 46.8 | 8 |
| `win-bench-opt-20260919-222646` | 251.7 | 4.0 ms | 3.2 | 6.8 | 13.9 | 19.9 | 42.2 | 2 |

| Run | chunks | queue wait mean | queue wait p99 | recalc threads |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| stock | 4294 | 174 ms | 351 ms | World Streamer only |
| optimized | 4294 | 30 ms | 74 ms | 4 × pzopt-recalc |

Utilization over the route window (sysmon, ~62 samples each):

| Run | machine CPU | busiest core | game process | main thread | GPU load | GPU W |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| stock | 29 % | 66 % | 271 % of a core | 88 % of wall | 70 % (p90 99) | 139 |
| optimized | 28 % | 70 % | 274 % of a core | 93 % of wall | 60 % (p90 82) | 157 |

Finding against the objective: at 252 fps under a 500 cap neither the machine (28 % of 16
cores) nor the GPU (60 %) is saturated; the game thread is (`main` 93 % of wall). The
optimized build is game-thread-bound on Windows exactly as on Linux. Stock burns more GPU per
frame (the per-frame tree/translucent pass) for fewer frames.

Not directly comparable with the Linux native numbers (zoom 2.0 vs 2.5, 500 vs 240 cap,
Windows driver 616.92), but the direction and the p99 gain (19.1 → 13.9 ms) match the Linux
result (19.3 → 8.3 ms at zoom 2.5).

One stock run only: no noise floor yet. Two runs were discarded and are kept with an
`-INVALID-` suffix: the first optimized run lost window focus for 11 s right after the world
came up (options.ini `focusloss=true` pauses the game; `IsoChunk.update` stops, so the
sampler's first route frame was 12.6 s and the route started late), and the first stock run
got its properties on one comma-joined line (`powershell -File` does not split `-Prop a,b`;
run-win.ps1 now splits on commas itself).

Not yet done from the list above: the manual drive at max zoom, walking through buildings,
quit-to-menu-and-Continue, and the visible-fps reading with the in-game limiter at Uncapped.

### Zoom 2.5 (same evening, after the 250 % zoom level was added)

Same machine, cap and route; options.ini `zoomLevels2x` now starts at 250, so `zoom=max`
gives 2.5 and the zoom-out buffer is 12800x5400, the Linux configuration. Two stock runs
for the noise floor. Summaries in `harness/archive/2026-09-24/baseline/windows/z25/`.

| Run | fps mean | frame mean | p50 | p90 | p99 | p99.9 | max | >33 ms |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `win-bench-z25-stock-20260919-224824` | 122.4 | 8.2 ms | 6.7 | 14.3 | 26.1 | 36.5 | 52.3 | 32 |
| `win-bench-z25-stock-20260919-225229` | 121.7 | 8.2 ms | 6.6 | 14.6 | 27.0 | 38.3 | 47.3 | 30 |
| `win-bench-z25-opt-20260919-224518` | 194.0 | 5.2 ms | 4.1 | 9.4 | 18.5 | 26.6 | 49.8 | 8 |

Noise floor between the two stock runs: 0.7 fps, 0.9 ms at p99, 1.8 ms at p99.9. The
optimized deltas (+72 fps, −7.6 ms p99, −10 ms p99.9, 30 → 8 frames over 33 ms) are far above
twice that. Both stock runs have the same cluster of 25–30 frames over 33 ms between 56 s and
90 s of the route (the W and N legs through the built-up area); the optimized run has eight
spread over the whole route. Chunk queue wait: stock 184 / 180 ms mean, optimized 31.5 ms.

| Run | machine CPU | busiest core | game process | main thread | GPU load | GPU W |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| stock 1 / 2 | 28 / 30 % | 74 / 72 % | 270 / 275 % of a core | 88 % of wall | 68 / 65 % (p90 99 / 100) | 127 / 120 |
| optimized | 26 % | 73 % | 270 % of a core | 93 % of wall | 52 % (p90 65) | 142 |

Same verdict as at zoom 2.0: the optimized build is bound by the game thread (93 % of wall)
with the GPU at half load and the machine at a quarter; stock spends more GPU per frame on the
per-frame tree/translucent pass and touches 100 % GPU in its p90 while producing 122 fps.

Against Linux native at zoom 2.5 and the 240 cap (route mean 6.2 → 4.4 ms, p99 19.3 → 8.3 ms):
Windows stock is slower (8.2 ms mean, 26.1 ms p99) and Windows optimized lands at 5.2 ms mean,
18.5 ms p99. The p99 gap to Linux (8.3 vs 18.5 ms) is the open Windows question; the driver
(616.92 vs the Linux 580 series), the 500 cap and the absence of MangoHud's frame pacing are
the candidates, and the 500-cap-vs-240-cap comparison is the first thing to run.

## What to bring back to Linux

- `console.txt` from the first optimized boot (the `[pzopt]` lines) and from a
  drive.
- The rough boot, load and fps numbers, optimized and stock.
- Screenshots of any artifact.
- `pzopt-frames.out` / `pzopt-chunks.out` if `instrument=true` was used.
- Whether the frame-cap combos and the menu cap worked.
