## What god rays are in this renderer

The camera is orthographic (30 deg down, from the south-east), the world is a grid of squares with walls on their N / W
edges, floors per level, roof tiles, and sprite trees. The light (sun, or the moon at night: `pzopt.Sky`) is directional.
So:

- every screen pixel's view ray is a fixed world line: along it `u = x - y` and `v = x + y - 6z` stay constant (the
  composite's own mapping, `Ssr.View`), so a volume indexed by (u, v, z) holds each view ray as one column. That is the
  froxel grid of Wronski / Hillaire made exact: world-anchored (cells of 2^n world units, toroidal), no reprojection
  error when the camera pans, only the columns that come into view are new;
- the directional light's epipolar lines are all parallel (the sun's screen direction): the epipolar and rectified-space
  methods (Engelhardt & Dachsbacher 2010, Baran et al. 2010, Chen et al. 2011) collapse to scans along straight lines;
- the occluders are known exactly: walls, windows (sill to head), doorways, floors and roofs per square and level, and
  the trees' crown proxies of `ChunkAo`. A 2D DDA through that grid is an exact shadow test, no shadow map needed.

## Pipeline (method `volume` + light volumes)

1. **Occupancy** (game thread, per chunk, 11 us a chunk, budget 400 us a frame, nearest first): one R32UI texel per
   square and level, 256 x 256 squares x 16 levels round the camera (toroidal): floor, N / W edge type (wall, window,
   open doorway, nothing; a curtained or barricaded window is a wall, a closed door too), room flag + a 16-bit room
   hash, roof tile, crown density. Rebuilt when a chunk's geometry bakes again (a door, a window) and every 30 s near.
2. **Visibility** (compute, a thread per cell): DDA toward the light from the cell: an edge crossed at the ray's height
   blocks unless it is a window between sill and head or a doorway; a floor or roof crossed going up blocks; crowns
   attenuate with a leaf noise (the gaps between the leaves). R8 volume, 324 x 139 x 32 at 5120x2160, zoom 1.
3. **Integration** (compute, a thread per column, from the top down, Hillaire's energy-conserving step): R the outdoor
   haze's in-scatter (height-falling, the weather's density), G its transmittance, B the light on an indoor cell, A the
   room dust's in-scatter from the cell up to where the column leaves the cell's room (reset at every room change: a
   pixel sees only its own room's dust, not a cut-away room in front of it or the hidden floor above).
4. **Light volumes** (the windows and open doorways the light comes through into a room, CPU prisms, rasterised): each
   aperture (glass between sill and head, or the door's opening) extruded down the light's way to the floor or the first
   wall, 12 triangles; its outer side's light from a CPU DDA. Into an RG16F target: R += +/- max(w - w_surface, 0) per
   face (entering +, leaving -: the sum is the view path inside the prism in front of the surface: Mitchell's light
   shafts / the shadow-volume path-length trick), G += +/- the surface's facing to the light for faces in front of the
   surface (z-pass counting: the surface is inside, the sunlit patch, with exact edges). Replaces the volume's room terms.
5. **The haze on the picture**, riding passes that run anyway (every separate pass cost ~10 us on this GPU whatever it
   did):
   - clear air, mist, rain without the game's fog: **the chunk composite** (stock `chunkShader.frag` or pixelLight's
     programs, patched after the cloud shadows and before the reflections' scatter) taps the volume at each fragment's
     own world position (its chunk texture's depth): `c' = sqrt(c^2 (1 - k miss) + a C F)`, miss = (1 - T) - F the air in
     front that the sun does not reach (k 2.2), a = 25 % of the lit air's light (`godRaysHazeAddPct`; the full veil
     looked like smog). No scene depth read, no pass: ~2 us. What the composite does not draw (characters, cars, water)
     has no haze.
   - the game's fog: **the fog buffer** itself (`fogShade`): a blended fragment pass over the fog's quarter-size buffers
     (near and far rows) multiplies each texel's transmittance by the shade at its own depth, `a' = 1 - k (1 - a)`
     through the blend unit; the fog composite's depth-aware upsampling carries it to the screen (characters included).
   - `godRaysHazeComposite=screen` (and the other methods, froxel lights): the quarter-size buffer + one bilinear tap in
     the stock `screen.frag` (patched before the colour grade), as first built.
6. **Light volumes and local lights** draw straight into the world picture (dual-source blend), culled on the CPU to
   the rooms the game shows (their building cut away, the player's level), depth-tested, uploaded only when rebuilt.

Phase: Henyey-Greenstein g 0.7 (35 %) over an isotropic floor, the angle between the light's travel and the way to the
camera, constant per frame. Light colour: the sun through the air mass (Kasten-Young, Rayleigh-ish per channel), the moon
bluish and dim. Haze: 0.0004 per square x (1 + 45 fog + 12 rain + 6 dawn mist), quantised to 5 % steps (the morning mist
changed every frame and re-integrated the volume), height scale 1.2 levels; dust in rooms 0.03 per square.

## Bugs found on the way

- GLSL `%` is undefined for negative operands; the volume's cell indices (u = x - y) are negative: every write landed in
  a wrong column (no light anywhere indoors). `imod` is floor-based now.
- `screen.frag` includes `util/math`, which declares `float max(float, float)`: a user function hides every built-in
  overload of its name, so `max(vec3, vec3)` does not compile there (the first run's patch failed silently to stock).
- The room's in-scatter showed as smoke over the street seen through the cutaway and from the hidden upper floor: the
  dust now stays within the pixel's own room (the room hash).
- The sunlit patches landed on the window wall itself (its inner face looked up half a cell toward the camera, inside the
  shaft): the patch is weighted by the surface's facing to the light (normal from the depth of the pixel's neighbours).
- The light volume target's scissored clear ran before the colour mask was reset: with the game's colour writes masked
  the clear did nothing and the uninitialised storage (old UI shapes) showed as translucent rounded rectangles.
- The route's teleport put the player back after `find=sunwindow`; the rig now moves the route's origin.
- **The game's `ShaderProgram` re-assigns every `sampler2D` of a program to units 0, 1, 2... in enumeration order after it
  compiles** (`onCompileSuccess`): `layout(binding = N)` does not survive it (the colour grade's LUT does only because it
  is a `sampler3D`). The composite read two random game textures as the god ray buffer and the light volumes: a
  garbage block, a band and a +53-level brightening over 94 % of the picture (gr-room7/8). The units are set with
  `glUniform1i` on every use now. Found with composite dev views 5-7 (what the composite samples) and an offline
  replay of the real patched `screen.frag` with the in-game buffers (right there, wrong in game).
- The sprite renderer leaves `glAlphaFunc(GREATER, 0)` on: a pass writing alpha 0 loses every fragment (the light
  volumes' first version). Disabled in our passes; `GLStateRenderThread.restore()` puts it back.
- The harness screenshots are unusable for this effect: `shot-game.png` re-renders the scene at 4096x1728 (our
  per-frame mapping does not match it), `shot-desktop.png` caught the queue's own desktop notification over the game.
  Pictures come from `devCapture` (the presented frames) + `harness/godrays/capab.py` (on / off frames of an
  alternating run).
- Light volumes: thin or twisted prisms (a window with a wall right behind it, corners stopping at different lengths)
  got some faces' signs wrong from a per-face centroid test: the +/- sums did not cancel (garbage blocks). Faces are now
  wound consistently and turned outward as a whole by the prism's signed volume.

## Light volumes: the windows and doorways (`godRaysApertures`)

The shafts people mean by god rays in this game are the ones through windows into rooms. Each window or open doorway the key
light comes through from outside into a room is a convex prism: its aperture (the glass between sill and head, a door's
opening) extruded down the light's way until the floor or the first wall stops it (a CPU walk of the occupancy); its outer
side's light from a CPU walk toward the light (another building, a tree, the roof overhang); the cloud shadows' transmittance
at the window every frame.

| version | how | cost (game, 5K, 12 windows lit) |
|---|---|---|
| 1. shadow-volume path length | every face into an RG16F target, +/- max(w - w_surface, 0) (entering / leaving), z-pass count for the patch, a composite | 26.6 us + composite |
| 2. half-size target | the same at half size | 15.4 + 16.4 (composite pass) |
| 3. analytic (Cyrus-Beck) | only the camera-facing faces, the pixel's view column clipped against the prism's 7 half-spaces in the fragment: the path and the inside test directly, nothing to cancel | 21.5 + 16.4 |
| 4. **direct** (default) | version 3 drawn straight into the world picture with dual-source blending: `beam (1 - dst) + dst sqrt(1 + gain lit)` (a screen blend for the dust, the exact display-space multiplier for the patch); no target, no clear, no composite | **20.5 us** (~6 offline) |

Frame level, uncapped, the same room: 658.9 fps with god rays, 660.5 without (MangoHud), p99 2.6 / 2.7 ms (gr-ab-on/off).
Dust motes (`godRaysMotes`): one speck per world (u, v) cell of 0.12 x 0.24 at a hashed height drifting slowly, lit where it
falls inside a beam in front of the surface (a hash per beam fragment).

## Local lights (`godRaysLocal`, `godRaysLocalMethod`)

Torches and headlights (as the game hands them to the lighting native: position, direction, cone, reach), lamps and fires
(active `IsoLightSource`s) light the dust of their room or the haze of the street (fog, rain) around them. Not in daylight.
The 8 nearest whose airlight can show (its peak, a ray grazing the light: `sigma I 2 pi`, over 1.2 %).

- `analytic` (default): Sun, Ramamoorthi, Narasimhan & Nayar 2005: a point light's single scattering along a ray has a closed
  form, `(atan((z2 - zc) / h) - atan((z1 - zc) / h)) / h`, less a constant `1 / R^2` so it fades to nothing at the reach; the
  pixel's view column clipped to the reach, the light's level and, for a torch or a headlight, its cone (a quadratic). One
  quad a light over its reach's (u, v) box, screen-blended into the world picture.
- `froxel`: Wronski 2014's injection: each light's in-scatter per volume cell (`1 / d^2 - 1 / R^2`, cone) x the way to the
  light being clear (a point-to-point walk of the occupancy: walls, windows, floors, so lamp light stays in its room and
  leaks out through the windows), accumulated down the view columns of the lights' footprints (this frame's and last
  frame's: the old one clears itself), tapped by the god ray buffer.

## Methods compared (the haze: `godRaysMethod`)

Morning mist (8:00, sun 10 deg up in the east, `--flag fog=0.3`, church lot), 5120x2160, zoom 1, the quarter-size buffer
(1280x540), GL timestamps in game, medians over ~1,500 frames (runs `gr-haze8-*`). The in-game GPU runs at low clocks at the
240 cap: the same passes measure ~2.5-3x faster offline (`harness/godrays/rig.py --time`).

| method | what | buffer pass | look |
|---|---|---|---|
| `volume` | the rectified froxel volume: each view ray is a column, visibility and integration computed once (per light step / pan / change), one trilinear tap a texel (Wronski 2014 / Hillaire 2015, exact for an ortho view: no reprojection) | **28.7 us** | reference |
| `march` | a jittered 8-sample march of the visibility volume per texel, interleaved gradient noise rotated by the golden ratio, the history reprojected by the world column (Toth & Umenhoffer 2009; Playdead's INSIDE 2016) | 65.5 us | the same after ~8 frames |
| `minmax` | `march` with Chen et al. 2011's 1D min-max blocks (8 slices) integrated analytically where V is constant and outdoors | 67.6 us | the same; in 32-slice columns few blocks are constant (a shadow edge or a room in most), the block reads cost what they save |
| `epipolar` | Engelhardt & Dachsbacher 2010: coarse marches every 8 texels along lines parallel to the light's screen direction (all epipolar lines are parallel here: 172 x 743 samples), 1D interpolation between samples at the texel's own height, a march of its own at depth discontinuities | 63.5 us | the same, a little softer along the lines |
| `blur` | Mitchell 2007 / Sousa 2008: a bright pass of the picture, three 8-tap passes toward the light (1, 8, 64 texels apart) | 91.1 us (incl. the volume's 28.7) | wrong for this view: the dark roofs smear into the haze, streaks follow brightness, not light |

The volume is the cheapest and exact; the others pay per frame what it pays per change. Kept as options for comparison.

## Cost (desktop, 5120x2160, zoom 1)

### How it is measured

Run-to-run noise on this machine (±15-30 us between two identical uncapped runs) is bigger than what is left to
measure, so every number below is a **within-run A/B**: `devGodRaysAlternate=1000 devGodRaysAlternateAll=true` switches
every god ray pass (game-thread work stays in both halves) on and off every second, and `harness/godrays/abframes.py`
compares the in-game overlay's frame times (`pzopt-overlay.out`, one row per frame with its epoch) of the two halves:
frames within 150 ms of a switch are dropped, and each on second is paired with the mean of the off seconds on either
side of it (the route moves; a scene change hits both halves of a pair alike). Reported: the mean of those paired
differences ± its standard error. Uncapped (`uncappedFps=true`, `uiRenderOffscreen=true`), GPU-bound (GPU ~92 %, game
thread ~47 %, render thread ~51 %), so the frame time is the GPU's. 30 s routes give ±1.5-3 us in fog and clear air;
night scenes vary more (lights come and go) and take 60 s routes (`route=S:2`).

Scenes (all `start=8147,11507`, zoom 1): **fog** 8:00, `fog=0.3`; **clear** 8:00, clear sky; **night** 23:00, `fog=0.15`,
torch and lamps on; **room** 17:00, `find=sunwindow` (12 sunlit windows; `--skip 15`: the teleport streams chunks first).

### What it cost and what it costs now

| step | fog | clear | night | room |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| start of the day (all passes, the per-pixel fog tap, the quarter buffer + screen tap) | 56.5 | 74 ± 1.2 | 29.5 ± 12 | ~36 |
| fog tap reads a one-byte shade volume instead of the RGBA16F one | 50.4 ± 1.4 | | | |
| light volumes depth-tested against the scene (faces behind a roof never shade) | 46 | | | |
| light volumes uploaded only when rebuilt, their own VAO (render thread 10.4 -> 4.9 us CPU) | | | | |
| fog shade applied to the fog buffer per texel (compute) instead of per screen pixel | 25.4 ± 3.6 | | | 12.2 ± 1.4 |
| ... as a blended fragment pass (no graphics / compute switch, no barriers) | **20.6 ± 2.0** | | | |
| light gathering: pooled candidates, near-lamp list (game thread 9.4 -> 2.0 us) | | | | |
| local lights: tight footprints (16-gon of the reach, a torch's cone hull) 3.3 -> 1.3 Mpx | | | **~7 ± 10** | |
| outdoor haze in the chunk composite (no buffer pass, no screen tap) | | 17.1 ± 2.1 | | |
| ... shade look (shadowed air darkens, 25 % of the lit air added) | | 17.7 ± 1.3 | | |
| scene depth unbound after our passes | 18.0 ± 2.1 | 14.4 ± 1.4 | | |
| **final build, 60 s routes** (`gr-final-*`) | **11.9 ± 3.5** (0.7 %) | **13.8 ± 1.6** (0.9 %) | **9.7 ± 6.2** (0.4 %) | **12.3 ± 1.0** (0.8 %) |

Noon, clear (no haze worth drawing, 9 light volumes on screen): 6.8 ± 0.9 us (0.5 %): the light volume pass's fixed cost
(its drawing is ~2 us). At the 240 fps cap these are 0.3 % of the frame's time; the game thread's share is 2-6 us a frame
(occupancy, prisms, lights), the render thread's 3-4 us.

Measured and not kept (the numbers are what they changed):

| idea | result |
|---|---|
| world FBO / viewport read back once instead of `glGet` every frame | 51.0 vs 50.9: no sync cost on this driver (kept: free, and other drivers may sync) |
| stochastic texture filtering (Pharr et al. 2024) of the fog tap: a 2D array, one slice per pixel by interleaved gradient noise | 51.5 vs 50.4: the tap was latency-bound, not filter-bound; superseded by the per-texel shade |
| NV coarse shading (`GL_NV_shading_rate_image`, 2x2) on the light volumes and local lights | light volumes 11.3 us GPU both ways; night within noise: neither pass is shading-bound (`godRaysCoarse`, default 1) |
| the light volumes without their depth read / without the depth test | 16.9 / 17.6 vs 19.4 (clear): within noise |
| the first depth read of a frame (a one-texel read in the off halves too) | ~5 us of the clear scene's cost (62 -> 57) |
| 1/8 buffer instead of 1/4 (screen path) | buffer pass 32 -> 16 us; superseded by the chunk composite |
| compute vs fragment quarter buffer (screen path) | 63.5 vs 62.1: same |
| light volumes and local lights drawn late (at the screen composite, a colour-only FBO over the world picture) | clear 17.7 -> 28.9, fog 20.6 -> 30.9: the extra FBO switch costs more (`godRaysLateDraw`, off) |
| the light volume pass with nothing drawn / with a plain blend | 16.1 / 16.4 vs 17.8: the drawing is ~2 us, the rest is the pass being there |
| the scene depth unbound from our sampler unit after the passes (**kept**, `godRaysUnbindDepth`) | clear 18.0 -> 14.4: left bound, the rest of the world's draws into that depth saw a feedback loop |


## Floating orbs of light (the maintainer's report, 2026-09-27)

"Two floating lights on top of my vehicle" in save `Sandbox/2026-09-27_08-41-12` (a clear night, their own options):
reproduced with a Jev-directed walk, `explore=lights` (`pzopt.LightWalk`, `harness/lights/light-director.py`: out of the car,
once round it, then from lit lamp to lamp, circling and watching each), god rays on / off every 2 s, and
`harness/lights/orbs.py` (added luma round each light between still on / off frame pairs). With god rays on every lamp had
a white-hot ball at the bulb with a bloom over its surroundings (the bus shelter beside the car: +184 luma, 17 orbs).

Two causes, both fixed:
- the local lights' closed-form airlight goes as 1 / h (h the view column's distance from the light): a singular hot point
  wherever a column passes through a bulb or a headlight. The light now has a core (`godRaysLocalCorePct`, 1.5 squares:
  h -> sqrt(h^2 + h0^2), the froxel variant likewise): a soft falloff, no point (+101, still a veil);
- lamps in rooms (the bus shelter's roof makes it one) lit the sunbeams' room dust (0.03 a square, 20x the air): a ball of
  lit air round every indoor lamp. Local lights use the air's density indoors too; a lamp in clear air does not glow, and
  on a clear night nothing is gathered at all (game thread 37 -> 0.1 us a frame in that save).
After: clear night 0 orbs (the one pair over the threshold is the character changing pose), fog 0.4 (glows drawn,
991 kpx a frame) 0 orbs, lamps +34 at most as a soft haze, nothing over the car.

Found on the way: in play mode (the camera's zoom eases all the time in a car) the volume was reallocated and recomputed
651 times in 45 s, one column at a time; its size now moves in steps of 16 cells with hysteresis (1 reallocation).

## Black world on AMD / Windows (2026-09-27)

Since this release the composite patches went in for everyone, god rays on or off, and AMD players under Windows saw
the whole world black. Fixed in `3f8f7dc` (patches only with god rays on at launch, the game's samplers back on their
stock units); causes, fix and triage: `findings-amd-black-world-2026-09-27.md`.
